⭐ Cat Hotel – Automated Reservation Management System

Google Forms → Google Sheets → Python ETL → Supabase → GitHub Actions
Fully automated, cloud-based reservation workflow for a pet hotel 🐾

🚀 Overview

This project provides a complete automation pipeline that transfers customer and pet reservation data—submitted through Google Forms—into a structured Supabase PostgreSQL database.

Everything runs in the cloud.
There is no need for a local server, manual syncing, or human intervention.

🏗️ System Architecture

Google Form  
    ↓  
Google Sheets  
    ↓ (every 15 min – GitHub Actions cron)  
Python ETL Script  
    ↓  
Supabase PostgreSQL Database  

🔄 Automation Cycle

Every 15 minutes GitHub Actions:

Opens the Google Sheet

Reads new or updated records

Normalizes and validates data

Syncs information into the following DB tables:

-owners

-cats

-bookings

-vaccinations

-services

Writes sync results back into Google Sheets (kayit_durumu & hata_mesaj)

🧠 Features
🔹 1. Owner & Pet Management

Owners are uniquely identified by (name, phone number)

Multiple cats under the same owner are supported

Cat records auto-update if edited in Google Sheets

🔹 2. Booking Management

Each booking receives a persistent booking_id

Edits in the sheet update the existing database record

Supports date parsing, numeric normalization, and data cleaning

🔹 3. Vaccination Tracking

New vaccine entries are appended to the vaccinations table

Historical vaccination records remain visible in the database

Google Sheets only shows the latest dates

🔹 4. Service Tracking

Pet taxi usage is tracked

Ensures 1-to-1 relationship per booking

🔐 Security

.env remains local and is never pushed to GitHub

Supabase credentials & Google Service Account JSON
are stored securely inside GitHub Secrets

JSON authentication file is generated dynamically during workflow

No sensitive data exists inside the repository

⚠️ Error Handling

For each processed row:

Column	Description
kayit_durumu	Shows Done or Error
hata_mesaj	If an error occurs, full traceback is written here
booking_id	Returned for new reservations

This makes debugging extremely transparent.

📌 Technologies Used

Python (ETL Script)

gspread & Google Service Accounts

psycopg2 (PostgreSQL)

Supabase

GitHub Actions (CI/CD automation)

Google Forms + Google Sheets

🎯 Purpose

This system was developed for a real-world cat hotel operation.
The goal:
Minimize manual data entry, prevent human error, and automate the entire reservation flow.

👍 Status

All components fully functional and ready for production use.
Supports multi-cat bookings, data edits, recurring vaccinations, and error-safe automation.

ENJOY THE SYSTEM! 🚀
