⭐ Cat Hotel - Automatic Reservation System

Google Forms → Google Sheets → Python → Supabase → GitHub Actions
Fully automated data processing and cloud-based reservation management system 🐾

This project is an end-to-end automated reservation system developed for a cat hotel. 
It enables the automatic transfer of customer and cat information, filled in via Google Forms, to a Supabase PostgreSQL database without any manual intervention.

The project is entirely cloud-based and is not dependent on any computer.

Architecture
Google Form → Google Sheets → GitHub Actions → Python ETL Script → Supabase (PostgreSQL)
Automatically triggered every 15 minutes with GitHub Actions:
Reads Google Sheets data
Cleans and normalizes the data
Processes it into the owners, cats, bookings, vaccinations, services tables
Writes errors back into Sheets (import_error column)

-Security-
.env is stored in the local environment
No secrets are found in the repository thanks to GitHub Secrets
Even the Service account JSON file is securely stored in base64 encoded form

✓ Error Management
After each line is processed, import_status = Done
If there is an error, the stack trace is entered into the import_error column
This makes it easy to track errors via Google Sheets
